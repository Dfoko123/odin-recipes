        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh ginger</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            Whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and 1/2 cup of the water until combined; set aside. Thinly slice scallions, and separate white and light green parts from dark green parts; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with salt and black pepper. Add chicken to skillet, rounded sides down, and cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip chicken, and continue to cook until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate, and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            Add ginger, garlic, and reserved white and light green scallion parts to drippings in skillet, and cook over medium-high, stirring often, until garlic and ginger are fragrant and lightly toasted, and scallions are starting to fall apart, 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            Whisk together cornstarch and remaining 1 tablespoon water until smooth. Add cornstarch mixture and soy sauce mixture to skillet. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            Return chicken and any residual juices to skillet, tossing to coat evenly in soy sauce mixture. Garnish with sesame seeds and dark green scallion parts. Serve over rice.
