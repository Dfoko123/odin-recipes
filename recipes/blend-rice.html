            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Poulet au vinaigre, or chicken 
                with vinegar, is one of those rustic French preparations for chicken thighs, that is both a pleasure to make and delicious to eat. 
                The tarragon, shallot, and wine pan sauce is rich, 
                but not too rich, and perfectly balanced.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    Mix salt and black pepper together, and season chicken first on the meat side. Turn chicken skin side up, pat dry, and season with the rest of the mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    Heat oil in an ovenproof pan over high heat. Place thighs in, skin side down, and sear until well browned, without
                    disturbing, about 5 minutes. Turn and sear meat side for 2 minutes. Remove to plate and turn off heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    Drain or use a paper towel to remove excess fat in the pan, leaving 1 to 2 tablespoons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 5</h4>
                    Turn heat to medium, add shallots and a pinch of salt, and saut√© for a few minutes, just until shallots turn translucent.
                    Add garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring, for another minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 6</h4>
                    Add vinegar and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add wine and broth, raise heat to high, and
                    bring to a simmer. Add chicken back in, skin side up, and turn off heat. 
                    </li>
                <li> 
                    <h4>Step 7</h4>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until meat is fork tender, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the 
                    center should read about 195 degrees F (90 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <h4>Step 8</h4>
                    Remove thighs from pan, and turn heat to high. Boil for a few minutes, or until volume is reduced by half. Add cream and cook until sauce 
                    starts to thicken slightly, a few minutes more.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <h4>Step 9</h4>
                    Reduce heat to low and add butter and tarragon. Stir until butter disappears. Add chicken back to the pan, and baste with sauce 
                    for a few minutes before serving.
